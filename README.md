*DESCRIPTION*

Here, the adventure begins for the quest to the Polaris Express! You, brave adventurer, will have to explore the world to find the fallen stars that will lead you to safety. The journey will not be kind, but you must save yourself! You will find resources to assist you in your endeavor to survive the harsh environment and monsters that will follow you.

You will enter three different biomes, so keep your eye on your health stats. Eat the food you've made or found to keep up your hunger and health. Try to keep them from falling to 0 or you'll be dead. Hide away from the sun during the day to avoid radiation damage and stay in the caves to rest up in between outings.

To assist you in navigation, find the stars fallen to the ground that will guide you to the next section of the unforgiving land. You will have to collect all stars within each biome before the fog gates will fall, allowing you to venture forward. Good luck in your quest, adventurer.
