*DESCRIPTION*

Welcome to The Polaris Express! You are the brave adventurer tasked with navigating the desolate land using the guidance of the spinning stars. Your ultimate goal is to find the holy grail to save yourself and your people, but the journey will not be easy. Along the way, you'll need to use all of your wit and resources to survive the harsh environment and the dangers that lurk at every turn.
As you journey through three distinct biomes, you'll have to keep a close eye on your health and hunger. Eat from your inventory to replenish your hunger points, and hide in the caves to gain health points. Avoid letting either bar reach zero, or you'll lose the game. Hide away in your cave to gain health points.  You'll also need to be mindful of the sun, which will drain your health with every passing moment.
To help you on your quest, you'll find spinning stars scattered throughout the world. These stars will animate and lead you to your next milestone, drawing you closer and closer to the holy grail. But be warned, you'll need to collect all of the stars within each biome before the fog will lift and let you move on to the next section. Collect all of the stars in the final section to exit the level and win the game.
When you first start the game, you'll have the option to choose between four different difficulty modes. Choose wisely, as each mode will present its own unique challenges. But no matter what mode you choose, you'll need to be brave, resourceful, and determined if you hope to emerge victorious and complete The Polaris Express.
