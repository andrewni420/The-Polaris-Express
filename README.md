*DESCRIPTION*

Our survival game is an adventure led by star-navigation. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world where you are running out of resources. In hopes to find a “holy grail”, you discover stars along the way that project into the sky and lead you to your next milestone. Each time, moving closer to the chance at salvation. You live in an underground bunker where you bring back your collected items and use a crafting system to make helpful tools. 

At the moment, we have only been able to implement basic functionality. On a mountanous terrain, you can move around to run into food to increase your hunger level. You can approach the enemy and click on it to fight and deplete its health. The player health takes damage when near the enemy. You can approach spinning cube "stars" to navigate to your next milestone. The environment goes through the cycle of night and day with stars. The player looses when health reaches 0. 


*HOW  TO PLAY* 

-	Use wasd/arrow keys to move player around terrain
-	Use mouse to navigate camera perspective
-	Attack using left click. 
-	Enter/exit caves using blue teleporters. 
-	The player will take damage during the day. Enter caves to refill health and escape the daytime.
-	Move towards rotating cube “stars” to animate them. Collected stars will form a line in the sky between the cave entrance and the next section. Once all three stars are collected, the gate will be unlocked.
-	Collect resources by picking up items and defeating enemies
-	Starlight is required for all recipes. Fill up your starlight meter by defeating enemies. It will also refill over time during the night.
